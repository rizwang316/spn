             <h3>About SPN</h3>
             
             <h5>Service Professionals Network is a place where professionals and consumers meet to discuss things ranging from business reviews to funny videos.</h5>
<p> <b>
Service Professionals Network is different from any other review or social media networking site in that it was built upon one simple concept: The Golden Rule.</b></p>
<p>

SPN lives out the Golden Rule by treating both businesses and consumers how we would want to be treated.
</p>
<p>
Our search results are based on how many thumbs up, double thumbs up, and trophies a business earns from consumers, rather than a system where one unhappy customer can ruin years of hard work through one negative review. 
</p>
<p>
Consumers will still have the freedom to tell the world what they think, whether it be good or bad, but one consumer won’t have the power to drastically effect where a business appears in the search engine through one negative review. Unlike other current review sites, SPN won’t charge a business owner to keep the competition off of their business profile.
</p>
<p>
Businesses can easily remove their listing at any time, but the goal is to provide an honest review platform that any reputable business would be able to use as a credible reference for potential customers. (Not to mention the SEO value SPN business listings brings to any business’s website) </p>
<p>

Consumers are going to love the options in our review system, because there is going to be so many different and fun options designed to help you express your feelings when leaving a review. 
</p>
<p> <b>
What do the icons on the business profile mean?  How does the search engine work?
</b></p>
<ul>
<li>

     A thumbs up is designed to show that you like the business and you would consider using them again. (Counts for one point in search results.)</li>
<li>
     A double thumbs up is designed to show that you really like the business and you would definitely use them again. (Counts for two points in the search results.)
     </li>
 <li>
     A trophy shows that you feel this company is awesome and is in your top 5 favorite companies for this particular category. (Counts for 5 points in the search results.)
     </li>
     <li>

     Consumers may vote for one or none of these options and can leave a review without voting for any of the above rewards.
</li>
<li>
     You must have a verified consumer account to leave a review. Business owners can reply to reviews as can other consumers.  
     </li>
     </ul>
